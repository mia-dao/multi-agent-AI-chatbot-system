Hi There!

This is my personal LangGraph Multi-Agent Chatbot project — built to explore how specialized AI agents can work together to understand, respond, and refine conversations in real time. 

🎯 Project Overview
Backend (LangGraph Multi-Agent System)

4 Specialized Agents:

Intent Classifier - Analyzes user input to determine intent
Information Retriever - Gathers relevant context
Response Generator - Creates natural responses
Quality Checker - Validates and triggers refinement if needed


LangGraph Workflow - Orchestrates agents in a sequential flow with conditional refinement loop
FastAPI Server - RESTful API with CORS support

Frontend (React + Apple UI)

Clean, minimalist design inspired by Apple's aesthetic
Smooth animations and transitions
Real-time chat interface
Metadata display (intent, confidence, quality scores)
Responsive design for mobile and desktop

🎨 Key Features:
- Multi-agent orchestration with LangGraph
- Intent classification and understanding
- Quality assurance with automatic refinement
- Apple-inspired UI with smooth animations
- Real-time chat with typing indicators
- Metadata display for transparency
- Responsive design
- Error handling and loading states
